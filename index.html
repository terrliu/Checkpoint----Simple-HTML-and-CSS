            Hey! This is Terrence :)
        </h1>
        <p>
            My life is about movies, music, photography, and people I love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Laid back, nostalgic, raw, real -- these are just a few words I would use to describe my photography. </p>
		<p>When it comes to my approach, I channel every image through the lens of the love I have for every little thing around me.
			I'm all about the inbetween moments; I thrive in the details.</p>
