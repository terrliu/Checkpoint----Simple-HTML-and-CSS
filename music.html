                <h1>Happier Than Ever by Billie Ellish</h1>
                <p>Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by American singer Billie Eilish. 
                    It was released on July 30, 2021, by Darkroom and Interscope Records. Eilish wrote the album with her frequent collaborator, 
                    her brother Finneas O'Connell, who produced the album himself. Eilish cited self-reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic 
                    as the biggest inspiration for the album.</p>
                <p>Primarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to meditative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019). Consisting of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, Happier Than Ever draws heavily from Eilish's rise to fame and the drawbacks that come with it. Upon release, the album collected acclaim from music critics, who praised its stylistic, restrained production, and insightful lyrics. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and its title track received a total of seven nominations, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.</p>

                <h2>"Billie Eilish Refuses to Stand Still Musically on the Heroically Honest ‘Happier Than Ever’"---Rolling Stone Review</h2>
                <p>When we all wake up, where do we go? Billie Eilish opened her eyes in 2019 to find herself the biggest sensation in pop music, when she was still just a kid on the edge of 17. Her blockbuster debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? made her an overnight legend, the kind who accepts her Grammy awards from Smokey Robinson and Ringo Starr. She was suddenly the world’s most high-profile teen, the object of strangers’ gazes, a target for mind-blowing amounts of misogyny. The homemade bedroom tunes she cooked up with her brother Finneas were recognized as instant classics, even when Billie was baring the Invisalign of her soul.
                    Her excellent sophomore album, Happier Than Ever, feels downright heroic, the work of an artist refusing to stay still. Absolutely nobody was out here saying Billie Eilish needed to push even harder and get even better — nobody but Billie. It’s a dark, painful, confessional album where she’s choosing not to settle into the role of America’s beloved kooky kid sister. She’s got trauma to figure out and secrets to share, but she’s not watering it down for anyone. The way Billie avoids reprising any of her “duuuh!” jokes is as bracing as Taylor Swift choosing not to do any of her trademark laughs on Folklore or Evermore.</p>

                    <h1>Valentine by Snail Mail</h1>
                    <p>Lindsey Jordan’s second album as Snail Mail is for anyone who’s been bloodied by Cupid’s arrow. Offered up by a self-professed but seemingly unlucky romantic, Valentine documents love in all stages, but mostly in disrepair. Its palette extends beyond pinks and reds: There’s the envious green of seeing an old love with someone new, the consuming black of bottoming out, and, occasionally, the clear blue of weightless bliss, however fleeting. Throughout, Jordan adheres to the credo that she first announced as a rhetorical question—“Is there any better feeling than coming clean?”—on Lush, the searing debut that turned her from a suburban teenager with wicked guitar chops into a beloved indie frontwoman.

                        Jordan, now 22, says she fielded 15 different label offers while she was still in high school. After signing with Matador and releasing Lush in 2018, she became a public figure and a magnet for parasocial attachment, drawing hordes of fans who saw themselves in her queerness and keen sensitivity. Amid this whirlpool of attention, Jordan found that her personal boundaries were too permeable; the overexposure caused enough harm to land her in rehab last year, an experience she mentions offhandedly once on Valentine. Afterwards, she handed her social media accounts to an assistant and hired a media trainer to help her deflect prying journalists. “Those parasitic cameras, don’t they stop to stare at you?” she sings over a foreboding synth in Valentine’s opening bars, pointing to the parts of success that give her pause.</p>

                <h1>Volume 1 by Pink Sweat$</h1>
                <p>Pink Sweat$, born David Bowden, dropped his debut album just a couple days before his 29th birthday. Pink Planet consists of 18 tracks, one of which features Kehlani for the remix of “At My Worst.” With his charming voice and unique vision, Pink won the “Best New Artist” nomination at last year’s Soul Train Awards with the mainly acoustic EP Volume 2. As Rolling Stone put it, Pink’s style is best described as “acoustic soul with a touch of alt-90s angst,” and Pink Planet embodies that completely. We can tell by the major notes and upbeat, yet relaxing melodies, that Pink creates his sound from a place of happiness. Everyone has their own “pink planet” – a metaphorical sphere that is different for everyone, their individual perception of life.

                    Pink Sweat$ is not trying to be unusual, he just is: an organiPc musician without the need to overthink in order to create. The stage name came from him literally wearing pink sweatpants during recording sessions early in his career, at his job at Philadelphia’s Sigma Sound Studios. At Sigma, he worked as a demo vocalist, wrote songs and produced artists like Tierra Whack and Florida Georgia Line, first being a rapper and the latter – a country duo. While sadly the studio closed, we can see diverse musical influences it gifted Pink in the long run. It gave his interest in music a great boost, since he did not have many sources of inspiration until he was 17-years-old. Growing up in West Philly, Pink and his family faced some challenging times, which were touched upon in the gospel-inspired album opener “Pink City.”</p>
                <p>rimarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to meditative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019). Consisting of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, Happier Than Ever draws heavily from Eilish's rise to fame and the drawbacks that come with it.

                <h2> SOULFUL NEW EP THE PRELUDE</h2>
                <p>Having successfully battled a rare esophageal condition, Bowden then decided to work on and release his own material, putting out two EPs to date, Volume 1 from which Honesty was taken, and Volume 2 a year later in 2019.
                    The Prelude is, therefore, the third EP from Pink Sweat$, whose name comes from Bowden’s apparent favourite attire to wear when in the recording studio, as his fans continue to wait for his upcoming debut album Pink Planet.</p>
